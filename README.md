# LiveSplit-AutoSplitter-WWII-Zombies

# WARNING
Right now this project is not fully completed, for the script that splits as soon as last zombie is killed, still need to do it for every map except The Final Reich. The Frozen Dawn it's also functioning but not as intended when you skip the rounds. 

I will update what's completed right below here â†“

## Completed:

-Splits when the round appears on the screen: [ WORKS FOR EVERY MAP ]

-Splits as soon as last zombie is killed: [ WORKS FOR The Final Reich ]

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# Recommendations:
-Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

-Use SubSplits

-Use Detailed Timer
